## Overview

This project provides a personalized and sustainable shopping experience, offering eco-friendly product recommendations based on user preferences. It helps users make informed decisions by providing insights into the environmental impact and ethical sourcing of products. The project includes an AI-powered recommender, an EcoBot assistant for real-time support, and features to track user progress toward more sustainable shopping habits.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for sustainable alternatives based on user preferences and values.
- **EcoBot Assistant**: A chatbot to assist users in finding eco-friendly options and answer sustainability-related questions.
- **Environmental Impact Insights**: Product recommendations include data on their environmental impact and ethical sourcing.
- **Sustainability Education**: Provides resources to educate users on responsible consumption and sustainable living practices.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their eco-friendly purchases and goals over time.
- **Community Ratings & Reviews**: Users can share feedback on product sustainability and make informed decisions based on ratings.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for the UI)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI for handling recommendations and user data)
- **AI Model**: Machine Learning (for product recommendations)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL (for storing user data and product information)
- **Chatbot**: NLP models (e.g., SpaCy, Rasa, or Dialogflow)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for secure user logins
- **APIs**: Third-party sustainability data integration for product lifecycle analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Any other dependencies mentioned below

### Setup

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh-986/PlanetPicks-technovate.git
   ```
   
2. **Open the Project in VS Code**  
   Navigate to the project directory and open it in Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   cd PlanetPicks-technovate
   code .
   ```
   (Note: Make sure `code .` works in your terminal, which may require setting up VS Code in your system's PATH.)

3. **Open the Terminal in VS Code**  
   Once VS Code is open, you can open the terminal by:
   - Clicking on **Terminal** in the top menu and selecting **New Terminal**, or
   - Using the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick)`.
   
4. **Run the Python Script**  
   In the terminal, execute the following command to run the Python backend:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Ensure you have Python installed and necessary dependencies available.
   - If you need to set up a virtual environment or install libraries, use:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # On MacOS/Linux
     venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Open `index1.html` and Go Live**  
   - Open `index1.html` in VS Code.
   - Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code to preview the frontend:
     1. Right-click on `index1.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
     2. If you haven't installed the **Live Server** extension, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`), search for "Live Server," and install it.

### Note:
- The chatbot component I implemented using a Streamlit API will not function as intended in this setup since Streamlit requires a separate web application to run the API. You'll need to rework the chatbot interface to integrate it into your main web application if needed.
